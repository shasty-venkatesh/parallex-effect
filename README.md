# Parallax effect

The parallax effect is a visual phenomenon where objects at different distances appear to move at different speeds when viewed from a changing perspective. This effect is utilized in astronomy to measure the distance of stars from Earth; as the Earth orbits the Sun, nearby stars appear to shift against the distant background stars, allowing astronomers to calculate their distances
